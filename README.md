# Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that let machines "learn" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on some set of tasks.Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.
